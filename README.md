# About Me

I'm Arnab, a math grad student at the University of Pittsburgh, researching computational neuroscience with Dr. Bard Ermentrout. I specialized in pure mathematics during my MSc at IISER Bhopal, focusing on Algebra and Number Theory. Currently, I'm diving into data science and machine learning at CMU with Dr. Robert Kass. With experience teaching at several institutions, I've honed my teamwork and leadership skills. I pride myself on patiently teaching calculus to students and expertly deboning Bengali fish dishes.

## Projects:
* Can median house value be predicted based on population characteristics? 
It was a poster presentation in a group and it was my applied first project. I did the data cleaning and visualization using tidyverse, Dplyr, and GGPlot hist and Corrplot. We tried to visualize the data to get an idea of how the cost of a house(dependent variable) depends on other factors e.g. no of bedrooms, the population of the area, vacant units, etc. Motivated from here, I am trying to write a project on California house prices with some predictive modeling.
