  I'm Arnab, a math grad student at the University of Pittsburgh, researching computational neuroscience with Dr. Bard Ermentrout. I specialized in pure mathematics during my MSc at IISER Bhopal, focusing on Algebra and Number Theory. 
  Currently, I'm diving into data science and machine learning at CMU with Dr. Robert Kass. With experience teaching at several institutions, I've honed my teamwork and leadership skills. 
  I pride myself on patiently <mark>teaching calculus</mark> to students and <mark>expertly deboning Bengali fish</mark> dishes.

          It was my first project and many data science staff went over my head but I started getting interested.
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          It was a poster presentation in a group and it was my first applied project. I did the data cleaning and visualization using tidyverse, Dplyr, and GGPlot hist and Corrplot. We tried to visualize the data to get an idea of how the cost of a house(dependent variable) depends on other factors e.g. 
          no of bedrooms, the population of the area, vacant units, etc. Motivated from here, I am trying to write a project on California house prices with some predictive modeling.

          This project was all about predicting when a machine is going to <mark>fail</mark> from the variable inputs. The main model we used here is logistic regression and we performed SVC at the end. In the general file I have given general introduction, performed EDA, cluster analysis, introduced different 
          models, analyzed their performance, and made predictions then as a Bonus we touched SVC and Neural Networks briefly.

          My ongoing Ph.D. research project
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          We are dealing with the population model and spiking model which are related by theta transformation and that is why the model is called by the name as theta model. We have shown the transformation calculation in particular. Then we wanted to find out a particular impulse through which we can jump between 
          higher and lower oscillations. The challenge was that we were dealing with a large population of neurons and that is why we had to start with the case study and bifurcation diagram. We got some ideas and I managed to find good parameters so that the neurons behave as we wanted in 9D then we extended the 
          case to the population of neurons and the system responded correctly. Now we were trying to summarise the result.

            Every company needs its networks properly administered and The Boring Compay is no exception. Digging holes is hard and I play my part making sure the whole company stays connected. I lead a team of 5 people and enjoy driving the company to try new technologies.

          During my time at Harvard I learnt most of my key skills that have I have taken through my career such as teamwork and working to tight deadlines. I thouroughly enjoyed my time as university and learnt a lot about a healthy work life balance.

          I spent a lot of my free time as a committee member of the *Harvard Mountaineering Club* taking on roles such as *Trip Secretary* and *Vice-President*.
